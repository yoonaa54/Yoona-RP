## Calendly integration

It's expected at this point you already created a Calendly user account. If you haven't, go back to Activity 1 for instructions how to do that, then return here.

- Modify `calendlyUserName` in `variabless_constants.dart` to match your Calendly username.

- Navigate to the `Book me for an interview` page in your app

- Attempt to book an interview with yourself - check if you receive the notification & confirmation?

Now mark this activity complete and move on to the next one.
