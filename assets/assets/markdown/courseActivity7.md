## Codeium, AI & You

Here you will become familiar with the Codeium VS Code Extension.

There is a basic intro available at:

[Codeium in Visual Studio Code](https://codeium.com/vscode_tutorial)

However you should take some time to experiment and think about:

- What questions will the extension attempt to help you with?

- Can you ask the extension questions you know the answers to, but the extension responds with a different answer?

- What settings can be configured for the extension? Why would you change them?

- Aside from using the chat interface of the extension, what other facilities does it provide?

- What interaction with the extension did you find most interesting? Save that as a file for later review

Now mark this activity complete and move on to the next one.
