In the next few activities we will check all prerequisites are installed & working.

Start by opening a command prompt / terminal.

If you installed using nix, make sure you type:

```dart
    NIXPKGS_ALLOW_UNFREE=1 nix-shell
```


inside that terminal, or copy it to your clipboard from the button below. You may need to **scroll down** to see that button.

Each time you return to work on an activitiy, make sure that step has been completed.

Now mark this activity complete and move on to the next one.
