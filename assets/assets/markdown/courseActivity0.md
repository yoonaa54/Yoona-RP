- Knowledge that you can deploy & run the same app on Android, IOS, Windows, MacOs, Linux
- Experience using a conversational AI
- A basic understanding of app development with Flutter

**By the end of today, we are aiming to complete Activities 0 through 7 inclusive. Lets go!**

## Basic terminology

`terminal` - you might know this as a command prompt or cmd window or something similar.

`browser` - you may also see mention of `web browser`. For the purpose of this course it is assumed that you are using Google Chrome.

Some of these activities will contain commands you can / should type into a terminal, eg:

```dart
    echo "hello from the terminal"
```

## Using the terminal with this course

Where such commands are listed, you can either:
- read & type them to a terminal yourself

or:

- copy them to the clipboard using buttons at the bottom of the activity (scroll down if you don't see them at the bottom of this activity)
- paste them into a terminal, using **Ctrl+Shift+V** or **Cmd+V** depending on your operating system. If you are more comfortable with the mouse, right-click & **Paste** may be available. 

__Before moving on, bookmark or write down the url in your browsers **address bar**, so you can get back here later.__

Now click the checkbox to the right of "Activity 0" to mark this one complete. You may need to scroll back up. Finally, move on to the next activity.
